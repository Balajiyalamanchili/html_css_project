## ✅ Best Practices

- Separate your HTML structure and CSS styles into different files for better organization and easier maintenance.
- Inside the `css` folder, use:
  - `*-structure.css` for layout and positioning styles
  - `*-style.css` for colors, fonts, and visual designs
- Create a separate HTML file for each page (like `index.html`, `aboutus.html`) to keep the project modular.
- Use consistent naming conventions for files and folders to enhance readability.
- Add comments to explain sections of your code when needed.
- Test across multiple devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.
- Clean up unused code or files to keep the project lightweight.

### 🔍 Example: Separation of Structure and Style

It is considered a best practice to write layout and design rules in separate files—for example, `file-structure.css` and `file-style.css`. In this project:

- The `index.css` file combines both structure and style in a single file, which makes it look cluttered and harder to maintain.
- In contrast, the About Us page uses two distinct files: `aboutus-structure.css` and `aboutus-style.css`, which clearly separates layout and visual design.

This method keeps your codebase organized, makes future edits easier, and promotes clean, scalable web development.
